# Lab Values and Expectations

Welcome to the Laskowski Lab!

<br>
We are excited to have you as part of the Amazon Warrior team! We strive to build an inclusive, supportive, constructive and fun culture in our lab. We recognize that everyone will have different needs and requirements but also offer different expertise and skill sets. These shared and distributed experiences, skills and perspectives are an asset to our lab.

Each person in the lab plays an important role in contributing both to the science we do and the culture we strive to maintain. Each person in the lab is expected to read this manual â€“ it provides useful information on how things are done in the lab, useful resources and expectations of all lab members.

TLDR: This manual will give lots of important details but essentially:
-Don't be a jerk
-Don't fabricate/fudge/alter data

<br>

The design of this page is based on the Fay Lab Manual.
