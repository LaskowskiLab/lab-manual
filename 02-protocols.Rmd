# General Protocols {#protocols}

* Intra-lab communication happens through Slack. You are expected to check your Slack as you would your email; and also to contribute to discussions that may be happening there. Emails are fine when we need to include outside people or for formal reasons. Use good slack etiquette â€“ threads, descriptive tags for files, etc.
* Important lab documents are stored on Box (all data, lab protocols, etc). Do not alter or delete any files that you did not create without express permission of Kate (the PI)
* Documents where many people need to edit often can be shared on Google (e.g. calendar).
